<h2 align="center">Project Description:</h2>
<p> A backend of a social media application inspired by platforms like Twitter and Facebook. The project is designed to support core social features such as sharing posts and photos, user interactions (likes, comments, follows), and real-time chat.

The backend is developed with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, following a modular structure with routes, controllers, models, and middleware to ensure scalability and maintainability. Authentication is powered by JWT, and user data is secured with proper validation and error handling.

<h6>Key highlights:</h6>
<ul>
<li>Secure user authentication and profile management</li>
<li>Post & media sharing with interaction features (likes, comments)</li>
<li>Social connections through friendships</li>
<li>Chat & messaging system</li>
<li>Clean and modular REST API design for easy frontend integration</li>
</ul>

This project reflects my growing expertise in backend engineering, database modeling, and API development, while also pushing me to explore real-time communication (WebSockets & Agnostic ) and advanced social media features. Itâ€™s a step toward building production-ready, scalable systems and showcasing my skills as a MERN stack developer.
